ðŸ‘‹ I'm a self-driven fullstack engineer who loves architecting, implementing, and deploying systems and helping teams grow. I've worked extensively with **PHP**, **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)**, and **Node.js**/**TypeScript**/**Next.js**/**React** stacks. I've gathered requirements, written project plans, planned sprint tasks, and launched products solo and with teams. I've developed **CI/CD pipelines**, **Docker images**, and **Terraform modules** launched to **AWS**. I am *easy to work* with, *find ways to be useful*, and *get things done*.

ðŸ’° I'm open to work fulltime, parttime, and contract, either remote or hybrid/onsite in Pittsburgh, PA. Email kaiser-4-hire@acmedinotech.com if you're interested.
