ðŸ‘‹ I've been a software developer for 20 years now and love to build with code. I've done a lot of fullstack work but generally prefer backend-focused engineering. I also know how to build distributed services in AWS! I can do architecture, write plans, and lead small teams. I also love writing documentation.
